## Why starting a blog?

I am not going to lie

I'm not going to lie to you, I don't even know if this blog will ever be read by anyone but me :cry:

Even if I don't have huge ambitions about the buzz this blog could make, I have great hopes that writing articles will drive my personal progression. After all, writing an article is digging a subject, taking a step back to find the best way to structure it and thus to progress! :muscle:

## What kind of content?

A little bit of everything!

There will be articles for :

- understanding specific technical points of React Native, or other technos that I discover. Tag : **hard-tech - :cactus:**
- sharing personal progress and development methods I like. Tag : **soft-tech - :cookie:**
- distributing training or standard tech templates, to be copy/pasted generously if you are interested. Tag : **template - ðŸ’¾**

I've prepared a small list (not prioritized) in a notion [here](https://www.notion.so/3c352c1b0dba4651aa6b691ca3fef4fd?v=facd5e4879ba42de99c6a4968a823f57), if you're curious to see what's coming. Feel free to comment or add items you'd like to see on the blog.

Teasing what's coming in the next few weeks:

- The benefits of estimating your dev tasks :cookie:
- Never use the prop style of ScrollView :cactus:
- An example of a naming standard :floppy_disk:
- What I learned from KentC Dodds' _Epic React_ and _Testing Javascript_ courses :cactus:
- What I learned from reading the new typescript handebook :cactus:
- A standard for using redux + immer + typescript :floppy_disk:
- My best sources of progress so far :cookie:

## Why is French the default language?

Indeed, the default language of this blog is French. There are several reasons for this:

1. I think there is an audience: there are probably French-speaking developers and not very comfortable in English who would be delighted to have content in their language.
2. I am not bilingual, and I am more comfortable in French to explain things clearly
3. The articles will also be translated into English to reach a more diverse audience (if I have the courage to...)

## About me

I'm Christophe Menager, developer since a few years.

I did an engineering school and a master in [Operational Research](https://m2rit-ro.recherche.enac.fr/) in Toulouse.

After working 2 years as a C++ developer in the operational research department of Air France, I discovered front-end development in React Native at the company [BAM](https://www.bam.tech/technologies).

Now, I'm a mobile developer at [Matera](https://www.matera.eu/), a startup whose mission is to dust off the condominium management industry!
